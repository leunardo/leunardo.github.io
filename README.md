## Tech stack

The architecture is very modern and simple, made with micro-frontends in mind. I have used [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) which is a javascript framework to create fast and lightweight [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). The language used is typescript and everything is bundled together using handcrafted [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) files aiming small bundles and more customization.

For Finance I used Angular PWA.

## Cloud Environment

Both sites are hosted within firebase. App & Blog uses Firebase Hosting. Blog also uses Firestore to store posts and Firebase Storage for posts' images.

## Contributing

Actually I doubt someone wanting to PR this repository because it's my personal work, although if you was curious about how I built it and know something I can improve and want to help, just drop me a PR or email me at leo@leonardoalves.dev. I will be very glad to know someone is reading this ðŸ˜‹. Thanks.

My personal website & blog (wip)

![Site image](./site-demo.gif)

## Tech stack

The architecture is very modern and simple, made with micro-frontends in mind. I have used [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) which is a javascript framework to create fast and lightweight [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). The language used is typescript and everything is bundled together using handcrafted [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) files aiming small bundles and more customization.

## Run & Deploy

### Site

- hot reload: `./modules/site $ npm start`
- build: `./ $ npm run build:site`

### Blog

## Contributing

Actually I doubt someone wanting to PR this repository because it's my personal work, although if you was curious about how I built it and know something I can improve and want to help, just drop me a PR or email me at leo@leonardoalves.dev. I will be very glad to know someone is reading this ðŸ˜‹. Thanks.

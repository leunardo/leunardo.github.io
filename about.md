### Who am I?

Hey, I'm glad you are here. It's nice to see there are people looking to know more about me. I'll be brief.

I am a guy who develops software in Brazil, more precisely in metropolitan region of Porto Alegre in Rio Grande do Sul.

Currently doing an internship in CWI Software, as a C# Developer, working on Equinix's projects.

In the weekends I like to stay at home with my girlfriend or friends, do some cool stuff and enjoy the little things in life :p

I'll list here some of things i'm interessed on:

* functional programming
* object-oriented programming
* domain driven design
* web development
* .NET
* play guitar

Hope we met ourselves soon!

xoxo, Leo.
